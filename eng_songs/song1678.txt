dont know what to say
I dont know what to do
But I can bare this pain o my Love
My heart cries for you my Love
My soul keep searching for you Love
There is No one like you
there is no one can replace our love
You are my love You are my Love
I say you truly you are my Love




                        
                        

Whatever I do its only for you
You are my love You are my Love
I say you truly you are my Love
Whatever I do its only for you
