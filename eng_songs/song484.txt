Short skirt vesuko shot glass anduko
 high heels vesuko time in is to party yo..
 Lipstick enduko lip lock nerchuko
 Cocktail anduko clock off chesuko
 Trust me o pilla arrest me anela
 Rest leni world nu chuputha
 The night is still young
 The night is still young
 The night is still young
 The night is still young ye ye…

Water enduko vodka anduko
 Mixing manuko just nannu kalupuko
 Dance flour cheruko dirty dance chesuko
 Trance lo thelipo
 That’s the best way to go
 Voppukove pilla just be my laila
 Let you have down right now
 The night is still young
 The night is still young
 The night is still young
 The night is still young..ye..ye…

Oh my fair lady penchinavey vedi
 Nuvve nuvve first guest at my after party
 Oh my heart baby let me be a hobby
 Ni Portrait paint chusta in my heart lobby
 Let’s go holli-date panilo nenu ultimate
 Nerputha romance up to date
 The night is still young
 The night is still young
 The night is still young..ye..ye..ye…
 The night is still young

Ni choti choti hip asalundo ledo cheppu
 Cause i wanna hold you like my morning coffee cup
 If you go to hell aa yamudu kuda thrill
 Name plates marchamantu indrudemo dull
 Na bike vumdaga rolls royce dhandaga
 You’ll love my roller coaster to ride
 The night is still young
 The night is still young..hu..hu…
 The night is still young..ye..ye..ye…
 The night is still young..young..young..young..young
 Ye..ye..ye..yey
