Rendu aksharale dacheyadam
 Aa lakshanalle laksha avadam
 Edam edamga edampakannuna
 Gundellni pindeyadam
 Oh very very sad
 Oh very very sad
 Oh very very
 Very very very sad
 The boy is sad the girl is sad
 They are just very very very sad

Lo lopale tega nacheyadam
 Aa lopale taguvachheyaddam
 Prati kota eda ide pata katha
 Malli ila cheppadam

Oh very very sad
 Oh very very sad
 Oh very very
 Very very very sad
 The boy is sad the girl is sad
 They are just very very very sad

Heart ane placelo hurt aye
 Hobby ee tamasha oo nasha
 Ishq ane risklo muskurat undada
 Hamesha ado nasa

Oh very very sad 
 Oh very very sad
 Oh very very sad
 Oh very very
 Very very very sad
 The boy is sad the girl is sad
 They are just sad

Vidipoyentala mudipadaleduga
 Manasayentala mattalevuga
 Alakochentala oosullevuga
 Alakochentala adugullevuga

Oh very very sad 
 Oh very very sad
 Oh very very sad
 Oh very very
 Very very very sad
 The boy is sad the girl is sad
 They are just sad
