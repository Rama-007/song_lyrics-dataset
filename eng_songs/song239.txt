We were so perfect
 Now I’m feeling worthless
 So1 lost without you
 Calm me I’m nervous

Come closer come closer
 I know you missed the way that I hold ya
 Don’t say that.. It’s over
 Don’t say that.. We’re over

Girl I would call in my life for anything
 As long as it makes you smile
 I fly cross the seven seas to be with you
 All I want is for you to be my boon

Girl you stole my heart
 Like a criminal
 My feelings about your way
 More than physical
 In ma life all that I could see is that
 You’re so perfect for me

Hey I just wanna know whats up
 God are you hearin’ I’m in love
 I wanna know just how you feel
 Am I dreaming or is this real?
 Is this real?
 Am I dreaming or is this real?
 Is this real?
 Am I dreaming or is this real?
 Is this..

I have been thinking about all those times
 When I know if you’ll still be mine again
 I know you know you’ve been on my mind
 Always knew that
 We were more than just a friend

I wish that I could go back in time
 Cause I need you back in my life again
 Baby stop and press rewind
 Just give med a sign

You and me.. You and me..
 Gotta miss what we used to be
 Baby stay.. Please don’t leave
 Girl we fit so damn perfectly

Come closer come closer
 I know you missed the way that I hold ya
 Don’t say that it’s over
 Don’t say that we’re over

Girl I would call in my life
 For anything
 As long as I make you smile
 I fly cross the seven seas to be with you
 All I want is for you to be my boon

Girl you stole my heart
 Like a criminal
 My feelings about your way
 More than physical
 In ma life all that I could see is that
 You’re so perfect for me

Hey I just wanna know whats up
 God are you hearin’ I’m in love
 I wanna know just how you feel
 Am I dreaming or is this real?
 Is this real?
 Am I dreaming or is this real?
 Is this real?
 Am I dreaming or is this real?
 Is this..

Just me and you together
 Always us forever..Ohh
 Just me and you together
 Am I dreaming or is this real?
