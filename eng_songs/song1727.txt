chal chal chal chal kaise halchal
jana gana mana muna jantar mantar
duniya motham danda rayulle
gudu gudu guncham gande raagam
pamulu patte padige ragam
paade vadevado okaduntade
what they want you to be is 
whatever they wanna see
kaalam nuvve kaalam nuvve 
neeke nuvve chikkavu le




                        
                        

they just take you when they take
dont just back think in his fate
raju nuvve bantu nuvve 
rajyam aagipodhule
market lo bhoogolam maskalu maayajaalam
ee lokam dammunnodi sommu le
market lo bhoogolam maskalu maayajaalam
ee lokam dammunnodi sommu le
petteyiâ€¦? nuvvaipo suari
where are you antu adige viswame
mala malu gola jadu galla leela
jhoomantram esthavu le
chal chal chal chal kaise halchal
jana gana mana muna jantar mantar
duniya motham danda rayulle
gudu gudu guncham gande raagam
pamulu patte padige ragam
paade vadevado okaduntade
what they want you to be is 
whatever they wanna see
kaalam nuvve kaalam nuvve 
neeke nuvve chikkavu le
they just take you when they take
dont just back think in his fate
raju nuvve bantu nuvve 
rajyam aagipodhule
