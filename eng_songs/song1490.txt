arey rey narthana thara
jigi vidhuthai chalagai ra
surhey suswaradara
vini thanmayame kaligera
etuga jimmik tera
thani annanna anukora
velige vulkavu le ra
padi chachennu ra jagusara
Jhoom mera sara duniya jhoom mera
saahora neeku saati poti ledhu raaaaaaaa…..
gaganame nee haddhuga chelaregina Maichel ra
vidhi rathani marchutu talapaina talluku taraaa




                        
                        

His two ways in making
When the whole world was watching
His song and dance amazing
You chanted grabbed that show
On the floor vonche
We can’t stop the yeve ye
Lift up the world Angel
You are a ‘thriller’ ‘bad’ ‘invincible’
arey rey narthana thara…….
jigi vidhuthai chalagai ra….
surhey suswaradara…………
vini thanmayame kaligera……
‘Moon Walking’ chesthunna, giragira tirigesthunna
munivellapai nunchunna hal chal kaligeraa…..
love song vinipisthunna, ‘ghost’ ai bedhiristhunna
‘heal the world’ antunna dil bajule kadara…..
vijayaniki vannega velugondhina dhruvatara
edhalayalanu elina KING OF POP ey raaaaaaaaaa…..
Its two ways in making
When the whole world was watching
His song and dance amazing
You chanted grabbed that show
On the floor won’t you
We can’t stop loving you
Lift up the world Angel
You are a ‘thriller’ ‘bad’ ‘invincible’
arey rey narthana thara…..
surhey suswaradara…..
Kings call the nations, causing, 
keeping human relations, its a thrill for
On a global scale, 
i run here four sides of the tales
See its not about races, just places, faces, 
when the blood comes from its way, it stases.
I seen the bright get duller
I’m not gonna spend my life being a coward.
Black or white evaraina social ga yedhaina
galamethina ganamaina samathe needanna…..
guinnessu grammylu billboard lu life time lu
thalavanche mahaniya cherithe needhanna…..
gaganame nee hadhuga chalaregina Michael ra
vidhi rathane marchutu talapadina talluku tara
Its two ways in making
When the whole world was watching
His song and dance amazing
You chanted grabbed that show 
On the floor vonche
We can’t stop the yeve ye
Lift up the world Angel
You are a ‘thriller’ ‘bad’ ‘invincible’
