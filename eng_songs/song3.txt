Art of Living
 ante, Art of Learning ante
 Naku thelisindhi o kontha
 Theliyandhi inkenthi I don’t know

I don’t know know know know know
 Know know know know know know
 I don’t know know know know know
 Know know know know know know yenno

Yenduko mari maatikokasari
 Chengumandhi chepa neetininchi yegiri
 Kotthagaalilo kotthasangathedo
 Nerchukovadanikemo
 I don’t know ah, I don’t know ah

Enni sarlu cheppina Good Morning
 Thaggade mari aa sun shining
 Kottha matter yedho
 Bhoomi nunchi roju nechukunna velugemo
 I don’t know ah, I don’t know ah

Only one thing I know (No Say, No Say)
 There’s so much to know (No Say, No Say)
 Wanna grow antu start ayye journey ki
 Steering ye I don’t know

I don’t know know know know know
 Know know know know know know
 I don’t know know know know know
 Know know know know know know yenno 

Kanti mundharunna adhbuthaalu yenno
 Vaatilona unna mystery lu yenno
 Intha kaalam chusi choodakunna
 Yenni vadilesano
 I don’t know yeah, I don’t know oh yeah

Question ai ee nimishamlo
 Telusukunta teliyanivennoo
 Nannu chere maru nimisham
 Naakinkem nerputhundho
 I don’t know, I don’t know

On a birds eye view (No say)
 Life ye learning avenue (No say)
 Every day edho nerpinche
 Refreshing anthem ye I don’t know

I don’t know know know know know
 Know know know know know know
 I don’t know know know know know
 Know know know know know know yenno
